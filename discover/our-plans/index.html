<h2>Planning And Voluntary Projects</h2>
<p>
It's important to have clear goals, so our users and contributors know where we are going. However, teams like ours, made up of willing volunteers, are unlikely to follow a detailed plan closely and expertise in a topic is not always available.
</p><p>
Volunteers, though, are constantly surprising us. Someone new comes on board and, all of a sudden, we make great leaps forward in a neglected area. Sometimes a developer pairs with a domain expert to add realism to a crude feature and the pace of progress becomes amazing.
</p>
<h2>Where To Find Them</h2>
<p>
Our plans are kept on Launchpad.net, which also provides our bug tracking service. <a href="https://launchpad.net/or/+milestones">They are known as Milestones</a> and there is more detail to be seen by clicking on each version up to the proposed Open Rails 4.0.
</p><p>
Please bear in mind that, in common with all volunteer projects, we cannot estimate or even guess at completion dates for any version.
